## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability, please follow these steps to report it responsibly:

## Security Practices

2. **Enable Two-Factor Authentication**: Enabling two-factor authentication is highly recommended.
3. **Avoid Publicly Sharing Sensitive Information**: Do not share API keys, credentials, or other sensitive information in public areas of the repository.

## Code Security

We actively work to ensure that our code is free from vulnerabilities by:
- Conducting code reviews for each pull request.
- Using automated security checks in our CI/CD pipeline.
- Responding promptly to any security alerts reported by GitHub or other third-party tools.
